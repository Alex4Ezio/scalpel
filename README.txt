# Twisty Timer #  

Twisty timer is a material design twisty puzzle timer for Android. It uses the TNoodle library to generate scramble sequences for all current official speedsolving puzzles.  

This is my first ever app, so the code has a fair number or workarounds. If you manage to fix one of them, or if you would like to add a new feature, just send a pull request.  

Special thanks to Prisma Puzzle Timer, TNoodle and PlusTimer for being my inspirations to create this project :).
